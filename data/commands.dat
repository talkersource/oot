# OOT (C) 1996 by Dave Jarvis and Ken Savage
#
# How this file works:
#
# 1) You may only change the name of the command, and/or the level number.
#
# 2) OOT will search for commands starting from the bottom of this file to
#    the top.  This means that when ".who" is abbreviated to ".w", it will
#    be found before ".with".  As well, ".wi" will be ".with", and ".wiz"
#    will be ".wizcast".  ".wr", however, will always be ".write".
#
# 3) If you rename a command, be sure to take the previous paragraph into
#    account.  Typically any user commands should be found before the Wizard
#    or God commands, lest the user have to type in more than is necessary to
#    execute the command.  For example, moving the line which contains
#    "wizcast" below the line that contains "who" will result in users trying
#    to do ".wizcast" whenever they type ".w".
