# OOT (C) 1996 by Dave Jarvis and Ken Savage
#
# How this file works:
#
# 1) Do NOT remove, nor change, the numbers that are listed to the left of
#    each line of text.  You may move an entire line of text to a different
#    location in the file, but ensure that the number goes with it!  Don't
#    ask why the numbers aren't in any particular order.
#
# 2) Lines that do not start with a number are ignored
#
# 3) Where it makes sense, the following substitutions are made within
#    each string (always keep them in lower case):
#
#    a) %u - the user's name who did the action (if only one user involved)
#          - the user's name who had the action done to (if two users involved)
#    b) %r - the name of the room %u was, is, or will be in (whichever
#            situtation it applies to)
#    c) %w - the user's name who did the action on %u (if two users invovled)
#    d) %l - the level of %u, or level of %r
#    e) %desc - the description of %u
#    f) %number - the number of smail items a user cleared
#               - the number of messages wiped
#    g) %s - what the user "said" (tell, shout, wizcast, etc.)
#
# 4) If a %u or %w isn't shown, it doesn't mean you can't add one.  Try
#    putting them in different places and see what happens. 
#
# Have fun!!

# Newbie & Arrested description
  0 - A %l.
